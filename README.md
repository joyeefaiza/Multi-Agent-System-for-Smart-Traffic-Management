# **Multi-Agent System for Smart Traffic Management**

## Agent Types and Responsibilities

1. Traffic Light Agents (TLA)

-Autonomously adjust signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions
-Coordinate with neighboring intersections to create "green waves"
-Adaptively prioritize directions with higher congestion
-Maintain state awareness of previous decisions for consistent optimization


2. Route Recommendation Agents (RRA)

-Analyze citywide traffic patterns to suggest optimal routes
-Communicate with vehicles through V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) protocols
-Balance route distribution to prevent creating new congestion points
-Consider vehicle types and passenger counts for fairness


3. Emergency Response Agents (EMA)

-Create dynamic emergency corridors for ambulances, fire trucks, and police
-Coordinate with TLAs to preemptively adjust signals along emergency routes
-Track emergency vehicle progress and restore normal operations after passage
-Maintain priority queuing when multiple emergency vehicles are present


4. Prediction Agents (PA)

-Forecast traffic patterns based on historical data, weather, and events
-Identify potential congestion hotspots before they form
-Provide decision support to other agents with forward-looking insights
-Learn from prediction accuracy to continuously improve models


5. Fairness Monitoring Agent

-Ensure equitable distribution of wait times across neighborhoods
-Monitor for and correct bias in route recommendations
-Track accessibility metrics for pedestrians and public transportation
-Generate fairness reports for transparency and accountability

6. Lane Monitoring Agent

-Oversees any slow moving vehicle and predicts any forthcoming traffic delays
-Monitor for unusual driver activity
-Detects speeding or racing vehicles and notify the authorities
-Detects jay walking

## State Preservation Mechanism

Each agent maintains its state through a combination of:

1. Persistent Event Store

All events and agent decisions are recorded in a distributed event log
Enables replay of event sequences for recovery and audit purposes
Supports event sourcing pattern for agent state reconstruction


2. State Snapshots

Agents periodically create checkpoints of their internal state
Includes decision history, learned patterns, and current operational context
Allows quick recovery after restarts without full event replay


3. Real-time State Synchronization

Critical state information is replicated across redundant agent instances
Enables seamless failover with minimal disruption to traffic management
Leverages consensus protocols for consistent state across distributed agents
